# Wordle Solver

Code to generate close-to-optimal guesses for the [Wordle](https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle/) puzzle game.
The game asks the player to guess a hidden word by making repeated, one-word guesses.
For each guess, the game returns a "coloring" that indicates, for each letter, whether the letter is in the hidden word and also whether the letter (if in the hidden word) is in the correct position.
There are <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=3^{n}"> possible colorings, where *n* is the word-length.

The algorithm uses a greedy approach to find the hidden word.
At each step, the algorithm finds the guess that maximizes the entropy of the distribution of remaining possible hidden words over the <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=3^{n}"> possible colorings.
Based on the coloring generated by the guess, the algorithm is able to iteratively restrict the set of possible hidden words until only the correct hidden word remains.

## Performance
![Guess distribution](./test/guess_distribution.svg)

Pursuing a maximum-entropy strategy is boring, but reliable!
The app is always able to find the Wordle in at least 6 guesses.
In a rare few cases it gets it in 2 tries.
But, sadly, it will never achieve the dream of the Wordle hole-in-one, as it chooses "SOARE" as maximum-entropy starting guess.

Also by virtue of this approach we do quite well even against an adversarial opponent like [Absurdle](https://qntm.org/files/wordle/)!
Because of the dynamic approach used there, to get interesting results please try the `custom_start` option in the `Wordler.start` method.
Finding the hidden word in 5 or 6 tries was typical of my Absurdle experience.

### Speed
Precomputation of data takes about a minute (73 seconds) but only needs to be completed the first run of the application.

The precomputed data take a few seconds to load, but finding optimal guesses takes less than a second for these small word-lengths.

This algorithm is not truly optimal (See [Cyrus Freshman's leaderboard](https://freshman.dev/wordle/#/leaderboard)), but performs almost as well as exhaustive methods, with an average guesses-per-word of 3.53.

## Usage
First, install dependencies into a conda environment (named "wordle_solver")
```
conda env create -f environment.yml
```
and activate the environment.
```
conda activate wordle_solver
```

# Pip Installation
Install dependencies using pip install -r requirements.txt

To use the simple commandline app with the python interpreter, simply:

```
>>> python3 src/app.py
Checking existance of precompted data...
Loading data...
Guess SOARE (entropy 5.89)
Enter Wordle response for "SOARE" (0=gray, 1=yellow, 2=green):	00000
Guess CLINT (entropy 5.51)
Enter Wordle response for "CLINT" (0=gray, 1=yellow, 2=green):	01102
Choose randomly from "LIGHT" or "LIMIT"
>>>
```

Here's an example with Absurdle:
```
>>> wordler.start(max_guesses=10, custom_start="arise")
Guess ARISE (entropy 5.82)
Enter Wordle response for "ARISE" (0=gray, 1=yellow, 2=green):	00000
Guess MULCH (entropy 5.21)
Enter Wordle response for "MULCH" (0=gray, 1=yellow, 2=green):	00000
Guess GOODY (entropy 3.25)
Enter Wordle response for "GOODY" (0=gray, 1=yellow, 2=green):	02202
Guess BLITZ (entropy 2.00)
Enter Wordle response for "BLITZ" (0=gray, 1=yellow, 2=green):	00001
Choose "WOOZY"
```

See the included `example.py` for an example of guessing the hidden word "crimp" for Wordle using the backend.
